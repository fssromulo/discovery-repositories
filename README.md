# Code Challenge RÃ´mulo

I created a project that list a bunch of Github repositories inspired by Netflix layout.

This project has a Sign in and Sign up area where old user can logged in and new users had a chance to register as a new user. Also has a discovery area where users can rate and filter some repositories. On top of this screen will show all the repositories that the user settled as his favorite by clicking on the star icon at the repositories card. Each user has his own list of favorite repos. And at least we has a screen when the user can update his infomation, for example: Username and E-mail.

## Features

I would like to Highlights some points of this project:

-  Authentication with Firebase;
-  It's using Real Time Database from Google to store user's data;
-  It was code with Vue 3 in Vite, Typescript and Vuetify;
-  I don't have enought time to improve my code with unit test.
-  I've used AWS amplify to deploy it;
-  In order to demonstrate my skills, I build the project from the scratch and made commit's on git always that a I've finished a little piece or a component.
-  In adition, pay attencion how start with dummy data on my components and then I fill it with the real data. I did that to ensure I was build the components with the correct behavior before add all the business rules into.
